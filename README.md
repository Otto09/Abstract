### `Abstract`
In the application, the variables p1 and p2 from the base class Punct are initialized with the memory addresses of the objects belonging to the derived classes Dreptunghi and Cerc. The arie(), perim() and deseneaza() methods are also declared for the Punct class. The body of these methods is empty. These methods are declared abstract. The Punct class is also declared abstract. The Abstract class contains two variables, p1 and p2, of type Punct. They are initialized with the addresses of two objects, an Dreptunghi and an Cerc, after which the arie() and perim() methods are called. The declaration of the Punct, Dreptunghi and Cerc classes belonging to the package desene_abstract starts with the definition of the package. The classes in the desene_abstract package are imported into the Abstract class using the import command.
